backbone-slim-authentication
============================

Unsophisticated server-side authentication for backbone.js applications.

*Not for use in production.* I'll be adding to it as I go, but for now it's only for jumpstarting projects. This is as barebones as it gets.

Uses backbone.js, require.js, less css, and the Slim php framework as a basic api and serverside authentication.
